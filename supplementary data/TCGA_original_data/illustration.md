This file contained the neoantigen peptides from 100 patient samples derived from single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in pancreatic and lung cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) public database. In addition, when we used neoDesign to generate vaccine sequences for these patients, 
the number of peptides per patient is limited to between 10 and 30 to maintain practicality. The result generated by neoDesign, ending with "_result".
